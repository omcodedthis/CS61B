# CS 61B - Data Structures
CS 61B covers fundamental dynamic data structures, including linear lists, queues, trees, and other linked structures; arrays strings, and hash tables. It also includes storage management, abstract data types and the elementary principles of software engineering. Additionally, algorithms for sorting and searching are covered. It also teaches Java, the programming language, during the first phase of the course.

## Weekly Scores
The HW, Labs & Projects for each week are graded using an autograder on [Gradescope.](https://www.gradescope.com/) The autograder runs unit tests that check the correctness of the code. Do note that the Total Points score is the same as the Autograder Score but is unavailable for the public version of the course. The scores are categorised by the week that they were issued. This section will be continually updated as I complete the course.
